# StudentTrackPro ðŸ“š

## Project Overview

StudentTrackPro is a comprehensive attendance and absence management system for educational institutions. It enables students and faculty to manage attendance, absence requests, notifications, and course information through a user-friendly web interface. The system supports secure authentication, file uploads for absence documentation, automated email notifications, and detailed reporting for administrators and faculty.

## Key Features

- **User Authentication**: Secure login, registration, and profile management for students and faculty
- **Student Dashboard**: View courses, attendance statistics, recent absences, and notifications
- **Faculty Dashboard**: Manage courses, sessions, student enrollments, and attendance
- **Attendance Management**: Take, view, and report attendance for each session
- **Absence Requests**: Students can submit absence requests with documentation; faculty can review and respond
- **Teacher Absence Notification**: Faculty can notify students of class cancellations with automated email alerts
- **File Uploads**: Students can attach documentation to absence requests
- **Automated Email Notifications**: Email alerts for class cancellations and absence request responses
- **Reporting**: Attendance analytics and reports for faculty
- **Role-Based Access**: Separate dashboards and permissions for students and faculty

## Technology Stack

- **Backend**: Python with Flask framework
- **Database**: SQLAlchemy (supports SQLite/PostgreSQL)
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript with Bootstrap (via Flask templates)
- **Email**: Flask-Mail with SMTP for notifications
- **File Uploads**: Secure file handling with Werkzeug
- **Authentication**: Flask-Login

- (Optional) wkhtmltopdf for PDF export (if implemented)

### Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/StudentTrackPro.git
   cd StudentTrackPro
   ```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment:**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   # On Windows:

app.config["SQLALCHEMY_TRACK_MODIFICATIONS"] = False

# Secret key for sessions
app.config['SECRET_KEY'] = os.getenv('SECRET_KEY', 'your-secret-key')

# Email configuration
app.config.update(
    MAIL_SERVER="smtp.gmail.com",
    MAIL_PORT=587,

# File upload configuration
app.config['UPLOAD_FOLDER'] = 'uploads'
```

## System Components

### Attendance & Absence Management

- **Attendance Calculation**: Automated attendance percentage and status calculation for each student and course

- **Notifications**: Email notifications for class cancellations and absence request responses

### Reporting

- **Faculty Reports**: Attendance analytics per course and session, students below attendance threshold

### Security

- **Role-Based Access**: Separate dashboards and permissions for students and faculty
- **File Upload Security**: Secure handling of uploaded files

## Development & Contribution

- Use feature branches for new features or bug fixes.
- Use `git status` and `git add` to stage only the files you want to commit.

## Deployment

For production deployment:

1. Set up a PostgreSQL database (optional)
2. Configure a production-ready WSGI server (Gunicorn, uWSGI)
3. Set up a reverse proxy (Nginx, Apache)
4. Configure production email settings
5. Set `DEBUG=False` in production
